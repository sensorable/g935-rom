# Sensorable Open Source Camera
### G935F ROM

This repository contains files for ROM flashed into G935F boards to turn them into autonomous cameras with no screen. The ROM is based on LineageOS CM14.1 (https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/hero2lte/build).

## Installation

Follow instructions from https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/hero2lte/install to do a manual install. An alternative option is to use a TWRP recovery for Hero2LTE from https://github.com/TeamWin/android_device_samsung_hero2lte, but the process is very similar.
